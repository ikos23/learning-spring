# learning-spring
A few simple projects which I created while learning Spring Framework.

```
< Learn by Examples. It's cool :) >
 --------------------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

They are really hello-world type of projects mostly :)

But there are many interesting examples inside.

Project [spring-petclinic-clone-kotlin](https://github.com/ikos23/learning-spring/tree/master/spring-petclinic-clone-kotlin) is a webapp similar to famous Spring Petclinic Project, 

but written 100% in Kotlin as I am a big fan of Kotlin :P
